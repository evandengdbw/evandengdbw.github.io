# Research Projects
  

## NFReducer 
***12/2018 - present | Net Lab of IIIS, Tsinghua University, Beijing***
- ***Description*** : In this project, not like NF-LRE focusing on open-source NFs, NFReducer concentrates on the NFs in NFV platforms(platform NFs), such as OpenNetVM, BESS and so on, and try to generalize and work out a software-analyzing methods to optimize the redundant logic's patterns in platform NFs. 
- ***State***: Exploring

  

## NFcc: Using Behavior Models to Develop Cross-Platform NFs 
***03/2018 – 1/2019 | Net Lab of IIIS, Tsinghua University, Beijing***
- ***Description*** : In order to deliver NFs adative to different platforms, we propose an NF development framework called NFcc for cross-platform NF development. It provides a platform independent language to program NFs’ flow processing logic, and uses a compiler to integrate the NF with different platforms. 
- ***State***: Submitted to SIGCOMM’19

  

## NF-LRE: Redundant Logic Elimilation in Network Function 
***03/2018 – 12/2018 | Net Lab of IIIS, Tsinghua University, Beijing***
+ ***Description*** : This project is about the redundant logics elimilation in network functions such as
firewall, intrusion detection system, etc. By analyzing the implementation of several classical NFs, 
such as Snort, Suricata, we found that there are some redundant logics. So we propose a software-analyzing method to elimilate the redundant logics with LLVM technology.
+ ***State***: The paper named "Redundant Logic Elimilation in Network Function" was accepted by the
SIGCOMM’18 poster and demo program.
