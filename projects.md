# Research Projects

## NFReducer 
*12/2018 - present*
- *Description* : 
- *State*: Exploring


## NFcc: Using Behavior Models to Develop Cross-Platform NFs
*03/2018 – 1/2019*
- *Description* : In order to deliver NFs adative to different platforms, we propose an NF development framework called NFcc for cross-platform NF development. It provides a platform independent language to program NFs’ flow processing logic, and uses a compiler to integrate the NF with different platforms. 
- *State*: Submitted to SIGCOMM’19


## Redundant Logic Elimilation in Network Function  
*03/2018 – 12/2018*
- *Description* : This project is about the redundant logics elimilation in network functions such as
firewall, intrusion detection system, etc. By analyzing the implementation of several classical NFs, 
such as Snort, Suricata, we found that there are some redundant logics. So we propose a software-analyzing method to elimilate the redundant logics with LLVM technology.
- *State*: The paper named "Redundant Logic Elimilation in Network Function" was accepted by the
SIGCOMM’18 poster and demo program.
